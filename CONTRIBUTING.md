#### How to contribute

Any bugs? Please let me know! 

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?






#### Submitting Changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. Please macke sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

  ``$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit ``
  
  ``> ``
  
  ``> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."``
  
  
  
I aim to have enough description of the code dispersed within the code itself in order to make debugging, or changes to the code easy.
For this reason, variable names can also be quite long but descriptive. 

Thanks, Florence
